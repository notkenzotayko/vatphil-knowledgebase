# Taxiing to the Runway
Taxi instructions can include, taxiways, runway crossings and hold short instructions. If you are
departing for runway 06 or 24, there is a possibility where you will be crossing runway 31. Do not
cross this runway unless you are instructed to do so.

If you are still unfamiliar with the taxiways, it is best to have your charts out to avoid any confusion.
Before requesting taxi, make sure that you have set your assigned code on your transponder and
that you are squawking mode Charlie.
