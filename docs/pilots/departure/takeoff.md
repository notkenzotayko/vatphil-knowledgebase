# Taking Off the Airport

IFR aircraft departing runway 06 or 24 will be instructed to maintain runway heading and climb
7000’ initially after departure. While for aircraft departing runway 13 or 31 will be instructed to
maintain runway heading and climb 3000’.

If radar services are available, do not turn or climb further unless you are instructed to do so. If radar
services are unavailable, you should only turn and climb further 3 minutes after you have departed.

If you wish to take an intersection departure, let the controller know since controllers will normally
give you a full length departure.

Controllers can also give you an immediate take off clearance. With this instruction, **DO NOT STOP.**
Once you are lined up, take off immediately and do not stop on the runway. There might be an
aircraft on final which might be some of the reasons why you are given an immediate take off
clearance.
