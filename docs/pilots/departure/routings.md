# Flight Routings

## Standard Instrument Departure (SID)
SIDs are not used in Manila if radar services are available (APP/CTR). However, you can still
request to use a SID if the controller will allow it. If radar services are not available, you will
be permitted to use a SID.

## Semi-Circular Cruising Level

If your destination is going to the **west**, you should file an even flight level (FL300, FL320,
FL340, etc).
If your destination is going to the **east**, you should file an odd flight level (FL310, FL330,
FL350, etc).

## Flights going through Hong Kong FIR and Singapore FIR

### Going to Hong Kong FIR
If you are flying through Hong Kong or will be flying to Hong Kong, you should have the
waypoints **NOMAN** or **SABNO**. Flights that will be passing through these waypoints from
Manila FIR is expected to file a flight level of FL300 / FL340 / FL380.

### Going to Singapore FIR
Flights going to Singapore should have the waypoint **TEGID**. Flights that will be passing
through this waypoint from Manila FIR is expected to file a flight level of FL310 / FL320 /
FL350 / FL360 / FL390 / FL400.

## Common Routing Mistakes
When filing a flight plan, the route is expected to start with a TMA exit. If a TMA exit is not
provided, it will be invalid.

The TMA exits in Manila are as follows: **AL, BETEL, BUCAL, CAB, CONDE, ESCAN, ALPAS,
JOM, IBAGO, LAIYA, LBG, NATIB, OLIVA, SIRVA, TIMON, VERDE.**

There are some routes that start with **LIP**. Change it to **IBAGO** or **LAIYA** as LIP is **not
considered as a TMA exit** and it will be conflicting with arrivals
