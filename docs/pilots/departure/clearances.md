# Getting your Clearance

On first contact with the controller that will issue your clearance, it is recommended for you to give
the following information:

- Your bay number
- Your aircraft type
- The ATIS information letter

Example: **“Manila Delivery, Philippine 123 on bay 35, Airbus 3-2-0, Information Alpha, requesting
clearance to Hong Kong”**

Once you have requested for clearance, the controller will either tell you to standby, or give your
clearance on the spot. Clearances include your routing, flight level restrictions, departure
instructions and your squawk.

Example: **“Philippine 123, cleared to Hong Kong via OLIVA W11 AVMUP A461 NOMAN flight
planned route, climb FL150 until further advised, runway heading on departure, expect radar
vectors to OLIVA. Squawk 1351”**

You must read back the clearance in full. Listen carefully to all details that the controller gives you,
and if you are unsure about your clearance, **let the controller know.**
