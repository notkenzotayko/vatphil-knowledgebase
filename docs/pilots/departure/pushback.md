# Pushing Back

When requesting for push and start, it is recommended for you to give your bay number for the
controller to easily find where you are.

Example: **“Manila Ground, Philippine 123 on bay 35, requesting push and start”**

Once you request for push and start, the controller will either clear you for it or let you hold at your
bay due to traffic. Clearances for push and start will include the runway that you can expect for
departure. The controller will not provide a pushback direction so it is recommended for you to push
to the direction where you will be facing the runway that you will be departing from.

Example: **“Philippine 123, push and start approved, runway 24. Advise when ready for taxi.”**
