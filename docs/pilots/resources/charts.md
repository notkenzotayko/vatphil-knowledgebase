# Aeronautical Charts

The Philippines vACC proudly provides a free and wide-range collection of aeronautical and airport charts for use when flying in or out of the Philippine Airspace without having to login on a different provider/client. 

This was initiated to enable the organization to facilitate the efficiency, effectiveness, and execution of our mandate, and to further provide support to those who don't have access to such documents.

It was made possible with the subsistense from the **Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) Philippines** and the **Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP)**. By all means, except this, we are not affiliated with the CAAP, the actual Philippines ACC, or any governing aviation body.
