# Initial Contact with APP

When arriving in to Manila, it is best for you to be at FL150 around 60 miles to the airport. On initial
contact with Manila Approach (RPLL_APP), report your current level and routing.

Example: **“Manila Approach, Philippine 123, FL150, inbound OLIVA”**

APP will then issue you further descend instructions and turns if necessary as well as the approach
that you will be using. By default, controllers will vector you for an ILS approach.

If APP didn’t give you any turns after you have passed the last waypoint on your routing, proceed
direct to the Manila VOR (MIA).
