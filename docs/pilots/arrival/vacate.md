# Vacating the Runway

You must vacate the runway as fast as possible in order for TWR to make best use of the runway.

You have not vacated the runway until you have fully passed the runway stop bar, so **DO NOT STOP UNTIL YOU ARE FULLY ON A TAXIWAY** or you might cause a go around.

The controller may give you a taxi instruction to vacate and some might not. If so, keep moving until you are vacated and hold position until GND has given you further instructions to taxi.
