# Active NOTAMs in Manila FIR

This channel is created to inform our pilots and controllers regarding the latest **Notice to Airmen** (NOTAM) releases taking place on airports within the **Manila Area Control Center** (ACC) and **Flight Information Region** (FIR).

For controllers, you may do add these things to your ATIS, while controlling. This NOTAMS is updated once in a while, if there are any significant temporary changes that needs to be applied.

Did we miss something? Feel free to open an issue [report](https://github.com/notkenzotayko/vatphil-knowledgebase/issues) with the following details: (Airport ICAO & NOTAM active). We will try to post your suggestion/s here, once a staff verifies its accuracy.

Thank you!
